# Did the live pass actually put the domain skills in front of the model?

# Written because the first wiring attempt LOOKED correct and was not: step() carried the
# skills, but run_paid_work() and assess_paid_queue() compose their prompts inline and
# never enter step(), so the live PAID_WORK prompt contained zero of them. Only reading the
# prompt the model was actually handed catches that. A unit test would have passed.
