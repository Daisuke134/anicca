# Open work on the Coconala loop

Ordered. Each item says what was measured, not what is suspected. Anything without
evidence does not belong on this list.

The four lanes run from `~/gig/releases/life-manager/<sha>/`, cut from `main` by
`gig_release.py`. See `README.md` for how the whole thing is installed.

## 1. ~~The browser step had no source~~ — RESOLVED, with one thing left to qualify

The binary comes from [CloakBrowser](https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser)
(`pip install cloakbrowser`, PyPI `cloakbrowser`): the wrapper downloads its patched
Chromium on first use and caches it under `~/.cloakbrowser/chromium-<version>/`, which
is exactly the layout `scripts/launch_gig_browser.sh` globs for, and `--fingerprint` is
that build's flag. The install step is now written up in the README.

**Left open:** `launch_gig_browser.sh` takes the highest installed version, and its TLS
compatibility switch is bounded to Chromium 145 and 146. A fresh install today gets
whatever CloakBrowser ships now, which may be outside that range — and outside it the
switch is silently not applied, which is the `ERR_TIMED_OUT`-while-curl-works failure the
script's own comment describes. Nobody has qualified a newer major. Until someone does,
a new machine may install a browser that cannot reach the site, and the loop will look
broken for a reason that has nothing to do with the loop.

Do not widen the `145|146` case on faith. Qualify it against the real site, on the real
network path, and record what you measured.

## 2. One paid order is stuck on an unstable feedback digest

**Blocks:** the lane finishing an order by itself. Measured 2026-08-19: the buyer on this
order is **not** waiting — their two newest messages confirm the work and say they are done
for the day. The lane holding still is currently the correct outcome, for the wrong reason.

`active_feedback_cycle.buyer_feedback_sha256` is pinned to one value while the live
`feedback_sha256` is another, so `_remote_revision_required()` stays false and the cycle
never advances.

**Root cause: the digest describes a window that is defined to move.**
`persist_latest_paid_buyer_reply()` (`scripts/coconala_queue_snapshot.py:1532`) sets the
revision boundary to `latest_seller_attachment` — the index of the last seller message
carrying an attachment — and `feedback_text` is every buyer message after it. That index is
computed over `talkroom["messages"]`, which is only what the page currently renders;
Coconala lazy-loads older messages on scroll. So the same conversation produces a different
boundary, a different concatenation and a different digest from one poll to the next. The
function already defends the *delivery* consequence of that capture variance, at length, in
its own comment — but not this one. Pinning a hash of a growing, capture-dependent
concatenation means the pin can essentially never match again.

Two further facts to design against, both measured on the live file:
- `feedback_sha256` is **not** the SHA-256 of `feedback_text` in the same file, nor of the
  accumulated rows, nor of their joined hashes. Whatever it digests is not reconstructible
  from what is stored, which makes the mismatch unauditable after the fact.
- Every accumulated row already carries its own stable per-message `sha256`. A cycle that
  named the specific messages it answers, rather than a rolling window, would be stable by
  construction.

`_feedback_cycle_patch()` in `scripts/delivery_project.py:144` is wired but guarded at
`scripts/paid_direct.py` by `if not (root/"state.json").is_file()`, so it only fires during a
project's first bootstrap. **Do not loosen that guard while the digest moves with the capture
window** — the concatenation currently opens with a request the customer already had answered,
and a builder acting on it would redo resolved work on a live customer site.

**Related, and worse:** the buyer text stored under `requirements/` includes a customer's
WordPress admin username and password in plain text, and that text is what gets packed for the
model. Neither the file nor the packet treats it as a credential. That needs its own decision
before anything widens what reads this file.

## 3. The estimate lane refuses one thread forever — the counts disagree

**Blocks:** estimate revenue on one thread. Not a race; waiting longer cannot help.

`dependent_category_types_not_loaded` sounded like a slow page and is not: the same thread
fails every pass while five siblings submit. The failure now records what it saw, and it says:

```json
{"mapping_loaded": true, "sub_value": "644", "mapping_has_sub": true,
 "mapped_option_count": 3, "control_disabled": false, "row_hidden": false,
 "enabled_option_count": 6}
```

The `required` branch in `scripts/coconala_estimate_browser.py` demands
`enabled_option_count === mapped_option_count`. The page offers **six** selectable
category-type options while `data-master-category-types` maps **three** for that
sub-category, so neither the optional nor the required shape ever holds and the five-second
poll always expires.

Six against three, with three mapped, has the shape of the previous sub-category's options
still sitting in the `<select>` alongside the new ones. Confirm that before fixing it: the
readback records counts, not values, so the next step is to capture the option values and the
mapped ids together and see whether the extra three are the stale set.

The count equality is a proxy for the real invariant, which is that the enabled options *are*
the mapped ones. Comparing values instead of counts would be correct whether or not stale
options linger — but this lane submits priced offers to buyers, so the change wants a fresh
adversary before it ships, not just a green test.

## 4. `negotiate_context` can never become "ready"

**Blocks:** the negotiate lane answering a storefront inquiry with the offer it was made
against. Two independent causes, both proven from the live receipt.

**4a. The envelope is matched against the current pass's listings only.**
`_materialize_inquiry_context()` (`scripts/storefront_direct.py:876`) is handed
`listing_contracts` from the pass that is running, and looks up
`(service_id, listing_version)`. The one storefront-origin inquiry on record cites a listing
version that has since been superseded. That version is present in
`~/gig/storefront-direct/listing-contracts.jsonl` — eight versions exist for that service —
but not in the set the function receives, so the inquiry lands in `missing_contracts` and no
envelope is ever written. A buyer inquires about the listing they saw, which by definition
may not be the listing that exists now.

**4b. Nothing acknowledges an envelope.**
`negotiate_context` reports `ready` only when every context key is also present in
`negotiate-context-acks.jsonl` with `status: consumed`. That file has never been created, and
`storefront_direct.py` is the only file in the repository that names it. The negotiate lane
does not know this protocol exists. Even with 4a fixed, the state stays `missing` forever.

Decide whether the protocol is worth completing or whether the context should be passed the
way the lanes already pass everything else. Do not "fix" this by relaxing the readiness test.

## 5. The funnel attributes most payments to nobody

**Blocks:** knowing which lane earns.

The storefront receipt reports its own source as
`source_status: "latest_completed_log_noncanonical"` — the funnel is reconstructed by parsing
the negotiate lane's launchd stdout log, because no canonical inventory is provided. The
result, honestly labelled: 110 of 116 inquiries and 5 of 8 payments have origin `unknown`.

A log is a rendering, not a ledger. Give the funnel the negotiate lane's own state as its
source, and keep the log path only as the fallback it already declares itself to be.

## 6. Retire the old copy in the other checkout

The Coconala code that used to live in `profitable-claude` at `skills/gig-work/` no longer runs
anything: no loaded launchd job executes from it. Branch `chore/retire-gig-work` removes the
tree and updates that repository's registry, start-all, status, README and tests to match.

It is pushed and unmerged. That repository's working tree is mid-merge on unrelated work
(`skills/reddit/state/STATE.md` unmerged), so it cannot be committed to by anyone but the owner
of that merge. Merge it when that clears.

## Not on this list, and why

- **`test_storefront_direct.py::test_noop_...`** fails, and failed identically on the release
  that ran in production before any of this work. The pass now reaches a proposal path that
  opens a real CDP connection the test does not stub. It is a stale test, not a defect.
- **`前回比 閲覧 +0`** in the storefront report is correct. Coconala's analytics window ends the
  previous day (`2026/07/20–2026/08/18`, `complete: true`, coverage 13/13), so two passes on the
  same day read the same window and the true delta is zero.
- **apply submitting nothing for hours** is the board being exhausted, not a regression. Of ~64
  postings observed, 26 are already applied to, 27 are cached ineligible and 28 hit a prohibition.
  The judgement fields either side of the repository move are unchanged; only the
  already-applied and cached-ineligible counts grew, which is what they do.
